# final_checkpoint

### Introduction
* This project implements a Grad-CAM algorithm and use it on the COCO dataset. The model that we use is a pre-trained model called Resnet50, which is pretrained with ImageNet. The model will take COCO dataset as input and Grad-CAM will visualize it.

##### Config
* Parameters for loading the images.

##### Examples
* Results from the Grad-CAM algorithm.

##### Notebook
* Results from `Examples` and explanation on the results.

##### src
* Main .py files including grad-cam algorithm and image processing.

##### run.py
* Load the images and generate results from the Grad-CAM algorithm.

##### submission.json
* `submission.json` contains the docker image required for running this project and a github link of this project.
