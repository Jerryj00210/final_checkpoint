### Introduction
* This project implements a Grad-CAM algorithm and use it on the COCO dataset. The model that we use is a pre-trained model called Resnet50, which is pretrained with ImageNet. The model will take COCO dataset as input and Grad-CAM will visualize it.

##### Config
* Parameters for loading the images.

##### Notebook
* Generating results from the Grad-CAM algorithm and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the results.

##### src
* Main .py files that running `run.py` involves
